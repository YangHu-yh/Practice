- different class
- Bracket as the new defined type
  - Stack could totally use other type such as strings or integer
  - mainly to store the position of the element that was added to the stack, so that not waste efforts to determine the position by looping it again.

- Need to differentiate places to use the function over the created stack or the Bracket element.
- Be careful about the following cases:
  - when there is no further character in the string to read while the stack is not empty either before or after adding the current element.
  - the next case is ')', ']', '}' but the stack is empty.
